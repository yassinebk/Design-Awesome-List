# A lot of ressources what to do ?

Watch an Introductory video of UI/UX design
Now you stand in one of these positions :
That's what i want GRAPHIC DESIGN
Oh WHERE IS PHOTOSHOP 
If you are into photoshop go for a beginner course (check the torrent section or youtube ) 
-> Go for the General Concepts that will save you a lot of time if you are into graphic desgin(they are more important than tools)
